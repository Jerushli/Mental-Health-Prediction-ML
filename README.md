# Mental Health Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This mini-project, titled "Mental Health Prediction," aims to develop a predictive model for the early identification of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress-related conditions. Leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) techniques, the project analyzes diverse data sources to provide a proactive tool for healthcare professionals, enabling timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

## Features

* **Multi-Source Data Integration:** Utilizes electronic health records (EHRs), social media activity, and physiological data from wearable devices for a comprehensive view of mental health factors.
* **Robust Data Preprocessing:** Includes extensive cleaning, normalization, and handling of missing values and noise to ensure high-quality input for models
* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Extracts and creates key indicators like sentiment scores from social media and physiological metrics to enhance predictive capabilities.
* **Machine Learning Model Comparison:** Employs and compares various algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Deep Learning approaches.
* **Performance Evaluation:** Rigorously assesses model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to ensure reliability and robustness.
* **Proactive Intervention Focus:** Designed to assist healthcare professionals in early identification of at-risk individuals, shifting from reactive treatment to proactive prevention.
